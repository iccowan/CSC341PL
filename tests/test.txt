# P3 Clue Tests

# The point of this test is to confirm that there
# is only one possible solution, and will be run
# manually from the command line.

# We know that the following is the output solution
# by running 'foundSuspect(Suspect, Room, Weapon)
#
# Suspect = mcallister
# Room = chemistry_prep
# Weapon = compiler
# (Confirmed by hand to be the correct solution.
#
# Now, let's try these individually and confirm that
# no other answers pop up. The input follows below
# and the respective output follows each input:

foundSuspect(mcallister, Room, Weapon).
Room = chemistry_prep,
Weapon = compiler.

foundSuspect(Suspect, chemistry_prep, Weapon).
Suspect = mcallister,
Weapon = compiler.

foundSuspect(Suspect, Room, compiler).
Suspect = mcallister,
Room = chemistry_prep.

foundSuspect(mcallister, chemistry_prep, Weapon).
Weapon = compiler.

foundSuspect(mcallister, Room, compiler).
Room = chemistry_prep.

foundSuspect(mcallister, chemistry_prep, Weapon).
Suspect = mcallister.

foundSuspect(Suspect, chemistry_prep, compiler).
Suspect = mcallister.

foundSuspect(mcallister, Room, compiler).
Room = chemistry_prep.

# From these results, we can conclude that there
# is only one possible solution which we confirmed
# by hand. Therefore, this program must work properly
# and end with only one solution to the problem.
